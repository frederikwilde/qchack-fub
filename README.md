This repository contains three source code files and one figure.
The figure shows that we have succesfully been able to excite the transmon into the second excitation state. The figure was created using modified_accessing_higher_states.txt

The file arbitrary_angle_X_rotation.ipynb has a function which creates a pulse that implements an arbitrary X_rotation.
